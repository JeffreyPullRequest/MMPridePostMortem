MixMax Pride Party Post-Mortem

Recap of Initial Expectations
MixMax Pride Month Open House. Good food, Good Drinks, Great Folks!
Recap of Outcome
The Moscow Mules were too tasty. I had too many and should have stuck to Soda.
Example: I agreed to write this post-mortem even though my calendar and schedule are highly impacted.
 
Stakeholder Input
Garret, please include any input here.
 
Roadblocks & Risks
The Moscow Mules (MM) made it hard for me to remember everyone's name. The alcohol content in these MM’s prevented me from going to dinner with the team after. They also increased the risk of having a Thursday Night Out On The Town.
 
Root Causes
Had the objectives been clear on my end this MIGHT not have happened.

The schedule I placed on myself to partake in libations was norealistic.
Additionally, the scope of the event shifted in-line with the pride cupcakes.
 
Main Takeaways
A key takeaway is always do what you say you will. Start with Cupcakes and end with MM’s in the future. Plan dinner ahead of time with the team.
Resources
Doordash - They deliver food and booze
 
Next Steps
I can hydrate now. Next steps are actually grabbing dinner with the team and learning more about everyone on a personal level.
